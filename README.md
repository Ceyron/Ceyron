### Hi, I'm Felix 👋

I am a student in the Master Program Computational Science and Engineering at TU Munich and a working student in Machine Learning & Simulation at Siemens Technology.

Ever since my Bachelor education started I have been passionate about higher (applied) mathematics, numerics and physical modelling. You can find all of this in the field of Simulation 🌊 as well as in Machine Learning 🤖. I am interested in the intersection of the two. This new interdisciplinary field is also sometimes called Scientific Machine Learning.

📺 On my YouTube channel I create in-depth explanatory videos on [Machine Learning & Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0P7KwJhuQ4vrzc3IRuw4Q).

On this GitHub profile you find hobby projects and submissions for uni courses as well as all the material of my YouTube channel (source code and handwritten notes).

I love coding in **Python**, **Julia** and **C++**. Some technologies I like to use:
* JAX
* Scikit-Learn
* TensorFlow (Probability)
* Streamlit
* Flask
* NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib
* The C++ Standard Library
* The Eigen Linear Algebra Library in C++
* OpenFoam

💬 My favorite quote: "The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

💵 These are organizations I donate to yearly:
* [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/donate): This Non-Profit supports many open source projects like Scikit-learn, NumPy, Scipy, Julia etc.
* [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org): Wikipedia is amazing. Where would I be without it.
