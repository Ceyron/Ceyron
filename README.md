### Hi, I'm Felix 👋

I am Phd student in physics-based deep learning in the group of [Prof. Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/) at Technical University of Munich, funded by the [Munich Center of Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). My interests are differentiable numerical simulators, machine learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization theory. 

👉 Check out [my website](https://fkoehler.site).

📺 On my YouTube channel, I create in-depth explanatory videos on [Machine Learning & Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0P7KwJhuQ4vrzc3IRuw4Q).

🧑‍💻 I love coding in **Python**, **Julia** and **C++**. Some technologies I like to use:

JAX • Scikit-Learn • TensorFlow (Probability) • Streamlit • Flask • NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib • Dask • The C++ Standard Library • The Eigen Linear Algebra • Library in C++ • OpenFoam • OpenMP • MPI

💬 My favorite quote: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

💵 These are organizations I donate to yearly:
* [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/donate): This Non-Profit supports many open source projects like Scikit-learn, NumPy, Scipy, Julia etc.
* [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org): Wikipedia is amazing. Where would I be without it.
